My first python rock-paper-scissors game.
Player versus computer CPU.
The program takes an input from a user (player).
Program validates the user's input for correct option.
The CPU chooses an option at random using the random module.
A winner is determined but when it's a tie, the proram repeats itself, otherwise, it ends
